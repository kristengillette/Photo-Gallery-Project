# Photo-Gallery-Project

Project created for <a href="www.teamtreehouse.com">Treehouse Tech Degree</a> program. 

An interactive photo gallery using JavaScript and jQuery. Thumbnails and photos were be provided with descriptions.

At the top of the page you'll have a search area where photos will hide and show depending on user input. When the user clicks on a thumbnail the photo will display in a lightbox. There should be a back and previous buttons to cycle through photos.
